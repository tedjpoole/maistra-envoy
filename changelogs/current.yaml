  area: oauth2
  change: |
    fixed a bug when passthrough header was matched, envoy would always remove the authorization header. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth_header_passthrough_fix`` to false.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fix a bug where the ext_authz filter will ignore the request body when the
    :ref:`pack_as_bytes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.BufferSettings.pack_as_bytes>` is set to true and
    HTTP authorization service is configured.

- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Fixed a crash when Envoy is configured for PROXY protocol on both a listener and cluster, and the listener receives
    a PROXY protocol header with address type LOCAL (typically used for health checks).
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where TLVs with non utf8 characters were inserted as protobuf values into filter metadata circumventing
    ext_authz checks when ``failure_mode_allow`` is set to ``true``.
  change: |
    Fix crash due to uncaught exception when the operating system does not support an address type (such as IPv6) that is
    received in a proxy protocol header. Connections will instead be dropped/reset.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed crash when HTTP request idle and per try timeouts occurs within backoff interval.
- area: url matching
  change: |
    Fixed excessive CPU utilization when using regex URL template matcher.
     
    Fix a timing issue when upstream requests are empty when decoding data and send local reply when that happends. This is
    controlled by ``envoy_reloadable_features_send_local_reply_when_no_buffer_and_upstream_request``.
- area: decompression
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where Envoy will go into an endless loop when using the brotli decompressor. If the input stream has
    redundant data, the decompressor will loop forever.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fix a RELEASE_ASSERT when using :ref:`auto_sni <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.UpstreamHttpProtocolOptions.auto_sni>`
    if the downstream request ``:authority`` was longer than 255 characters.
